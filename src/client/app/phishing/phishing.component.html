  <h2><strong>phishing</strong></h2>
  Phishing is an attempt to use email to cheat you into providing sensitive information or installing malware. Phishing mails do this by attempting to fool you into thinking that their senders are trustworthy entities.

Never open attached files or click links in mails which you suspect might be attempts at phishing.
