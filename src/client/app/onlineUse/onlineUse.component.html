Even if your machine has a fully updated <a href="http://www.imshealth.com/en/thought-leadership/quintilesims-institute">antivirus software</a> , operating system, etc. You risk that a website you visit is infected with malicious code that our systems do not yet know.

 	<li>If you use the link private so considerate towards others. The key words areÂ  <strong>common sense</strong> . First of all, it must not have a scope that bothers other people's work, and you should never use the IMS's Internet commercially.</li>
 	<li>When using the IMS's Internet connection "appears" you're out on the net with an identity which represents, or traceable to, Aarhus IMS. Of course you have freedom of speech, but you may not speak on behalf of the IMS (or look as if you do it) unless you are authorized to do so, and you can not with your behavior could bring the IMS into disrepute.</li>
 	<li>Do not use your Internet connection for illegal activities. Remember to IMS IT logs everything and can use these logs to find the identity of people who abuse the Internet connection. Download any file sharing of pirated software, movies, music and other equivalent material is not only criminal, it is also a direct attack on the IMS's IT security and can result in severe disciplinary sanctions.</li>
